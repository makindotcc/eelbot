I NO LONGER DEVELOP EELBOT
--------------------------

Minimalist "snake" bots for testing Minecraft servers. Program works as a proxy. When you are joining, the proxy connects specified amount of bots to server. You are controlling all of them at once in standard Minecraft client.

Compiling
---------

1. Download and install Go from http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list
2. Set up your Go environment
3. Clone project to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/Teapot418/eelbot`
4. Run `go build` in eelbot folder

Usage
-----

```
./eelbot [options...]
```

Options:
* count - amount of bots to be connected
* eeld - timeout between bots' actions (snake effect)
* errd - timeout in milliseconds if client was kicked while connecting
* joind - timeout between bot joins in milliseconds
* proxy - proxy address (client is connecting to it)
* target - target server address
* keep - keep connections after main client disconnects
* ver18 - use 1.8+ version (packet compression)

Example: 1.8, 30 bots, timeout between bots actions = 200ms, proxy on `0.0.0.0:25588` and target server on `127.0.0.1:25565`

```
./eelbot -ver18=true -count=30 -eeld=200 -proxy=0.0.0.0:25588 -target=127.0.0.1:25565
```

Then join from Minecraft client to `0.0.0.0:25588`. Eelbot will connect bots to target server.
